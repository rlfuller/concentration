# Concentration

Concentration is the classic memory game. The objective of the game is to match all the pairs of cards in the shortest amount of time. A player is presented with a set of cards all face down. The play turns over two cards at a time, hoping that the image on the back of the card is a match. If the cards do not match, the system will turn the cards back over. The player continues selecting cards in pairs of two until all the matches are found.
